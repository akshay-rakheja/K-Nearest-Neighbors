# KNN
### Data exploration, KNN classification and analysis on Heart Disease and Iris Datasets

As part of an assignment for a graduate course (ECE 657A) at UWaterloo, we were asked to use data exploration techniques to understand the correlation between the features. This was accomplished using pair plots and correlation matrix where we can clearly see positive/negative correlations and coefficients between different features.
